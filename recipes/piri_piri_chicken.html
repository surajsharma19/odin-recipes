    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken is marinated in a spicy piri piri pepper sauce, then grilled for this simple but flavorful African-inspired recipe. I like to serve this with a cool yogurt sauce and fonio pilaf.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 African bird's eye chile peppers</li>   
        <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>   
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>   
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>   
        <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>   
        <li>2 limes, juiced</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, or to taste</li>   
        <li>1 chicken breast, cut in half</li>   
        <li>2 chicken leg quarters with skin</li>   
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use rubber gloves to mince the chiles and place into a mixing bowl. Add cilantro, garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix piri piri sauce well.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts and legs into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and shake gently to completely cover chicken. Put the bag in the refrigerator to marinate at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove bag from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow chicken to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, rotating as necessary to cook evenly, until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
